1.
In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming which uses objects and classes in programming.
 It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc.
2.
The inheritance search is simply a search of the tree from bottom to top looking for the lowest occurrence of an attribute name.
 Code implies the shape of such trees.
3.
A class is a blue print. Object . It is the copy of the class. 
Intance is a variable which is used to hold memory address of the object.
4.
Python function arguments are used in order to pass data values through the functions declared in the program.
5.
The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.
 Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. 
The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created. 
6.
The new operator requires a single, postfix argument a call to a constructor.
 The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate. The new operator returns a reference to the object it created.
7.
a.Declaration − A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.
b.Instantiation − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.
c.Initialization − The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.
8.
The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass.
 A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. 
Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well.
